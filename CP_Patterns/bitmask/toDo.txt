Awesome! Here's a list of popular Bitmask DP problems and interview-style bitmask tricks you should definitely explore:

💡 Bitmask DP Problems (Classic & Interview-Favorite)
Problem	Description	Platform
✅ Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)	Find the minimum path to visit all cities and return to start using DP + bitmask	Standard
🔒 LC 847. Shortest Path Visiting All Nodes	Bitmask + BFS or DP to visit all nodes in a graph	Leetcode
🎓 Partition into K Equal Sum Subsets	Use bitmask to track taken elements, DP to store valid partitions	Leetcode 698
🧠 LC 1125. Smallest Sufficient Team	Bitmask to represent required skills and teams	Leetcode
🧊 Count Number of Valid Pickup and Delivery Options	DP + permutations with constraints	Leetcode 1359
⚔️ Minimum Cost to Connect Two Groups of Points	Bitmask to track group coverage	Leetcode 1595
💰 Assignment Problem	Assign tasks to workers with minimum cost (classic Bitmask DP)	Competitive
🎯 Bitmask Tricks for Interviews
Trick	Description	Code
Check if k-th bit is set	(num & (1 << k)) != 0	✅
Set the k-th bit	`num	= (1 << k)`
Unset the k-th bit	num &= ~(1 << k)	✅
Toggle the k-th bit	num ^= (1 << k)	✅
Count set bits (population count)	Integer.bitCount(num)	✅
Subset iteration over bitmask mask	for (int sub = mask; sub > 0; sub = (sub - 1) & mask)	🔥 Subset DP
🧪 Want a Real Challenge?
Try this one:

🔥 "Find the number of ways to color a graph so that no two adjacent nodes have the same color using k colors."

Use bitmask to represent coloring state.
DP[state][node] to track transitions.
Hard, but beautiful.
